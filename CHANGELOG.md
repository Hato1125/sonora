## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Columns can be reordered by dragging a header and resized by dragging its edge. Widths, order,
  hidden columns and the active sort are remembered per table between sessions.
- Library sections switch between the table and a card grid through a new View control, remembered
  per section.
- A sort control in the toolbar, so sorting works in card mode as well as in the table.
- Card mode groups rows under first-letter or year headings when the active sort is groupable.
- Album and playlist artwork carries a Play button that starts, pauses and resumes in place.
- Go to album and Go to artist in the track context menu; the latter opens a submenu when a track
  has several artists.
- Queued tracks gained clickable artists, a remove button on hover and the full track menu.
- Liked tracks, with like icons shown on tracks inside albums and playlists.

### Changed

- Track, album and playlist cards are now one primitive rather than four parallel implementations.
- Right-click context menus are a separate element from button dropdowns.
- Every icon was refreshed from Lucide 1.30.0, and the sidebar toggle moved to the panel-left family
  so its divider and arrow match a left-hand panel.
- Album cards show the artist instead of the release type.

### Fixed

- Column headers no longer overlap each other; a column either shows its full heading or is dropped.
- Clicking a menu trigger a second time closes the menu instead of reopening it.
- Selecting an option no longer dismisses the filters, columns or sort dropdown, so several options
  can be picked and the duration slider can be dragged.
- Right-clicking another row moves the context menu in one click.
- Submenus no longer block clicks across the whole window.
- Ghost and outline buttons show a visible hover on the player bar, which is painted in the same
  colour their hover used to be.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Added an About tab in settings carrying the copyright, the warranty disclaimer and links to the
  license and the source.
- Added `THIRD-PARTY.md`, listing every bundled dependency and the full text of every license.
  Packages and release archives now ship it alongside the Inter and Lucide license files.
- Added a Nix package that installs the prebuilt release binary instead of compiling GPUI.

### Changed

- **Licensing.** Sonora is now released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
  Earlier releases carried no license file at all, which left them undistributable; GPUI depends on
  `zlog` and `ztracing` from the Zed repository, both GPL-3.0-or-later, so every binary ever built
  from this tree was already covered by the GPL. Versions 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are therefore to be read
  as GPL-3.0-or-later as well.

### Fixed

- Spaced the sidebar tabs apart and drew menus on the popover surface.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Localized the interface with Fluent, shipping English, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish.
- Added a language setting that follows the system locale by default.
- Added an application icon for macOS, Linux and the disk image.

### Changed

- Releases now ship bare executables for Linux and Windows and a universal disk image for macOS.
- Shuffle moved into the queue, so the queue panel shows the order that will actually play.

### Fixed

- Capped the volume taper at unity gain; the top of the slider no longer clips.
- Aligned the scrubber thumb with the pointer across the whole track.
